<h2>Task 3</h2>
<p>Within our design, we demonstrate a high degree of cohesion while maintaining a low amount of coupling between modules, a necessity for a good design.</p>
<p>Many of our classes have very concise methods that all pertain to one object without requiring much more than user input and the class itself.</p>
<p>For our main data objects we have all related functions within the classes themselves for easier readability making a more cohesive design overall.</p>
<p>As for the connections between classes, we’ve made them as simple as possible to allow easier following of the flow of the design.</p>
<p>We pass simple data types or data structures only when necessary to avoid later confusion when implementing the design and make sure to use every part of said data structures to avoid wasted resources.</p>
<p>These decisions within our design help to minimize the structure of our diagrams and will allow us to much more efficiently implement our design in a later project.</p>
