The following project is not entirely my own work. It was a group effort over the course of an entire semester beginning with UML diagrams of the system. 
The original project was pushed to BitBucket, not Github, but I have attempted to clone the history from BitBucket.

The other 4 students who worked on the project were Joseph Daly, Zachary Stiles, Jacob Pacheco, and Jacob Grinstead.
The task distribution is detailed in manual/Chocoholics Anonymous User Manual.pdf.

Each class and function also has a javadoc detailing author information.
