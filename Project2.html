<h2>Task 1:</h2>
<p>The majority of the ChocAn Data Center’s processes will be computerized besides physical record keeping and physical card verification. The computerized sections will be constructed in Java for its object oriented design structure.</p>
<p>All member, provider, report, and EFT data will be stored in the ChocAn Data Center. The necessary hardware is ChocAn terminals for providers, card reader, operator terminals, and the ChocAn data center’s hardware.</p>
<p>ChocAn’s system interacts with systems created by outside companies, like ACME’s accounting programs. Users must be able to manage ChocAn members and providers, as well as request ChocAn billing information.</p>
<p>Management consists of adding, removing, and editing information of said members and providers.</p>
